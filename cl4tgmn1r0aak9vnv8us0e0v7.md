# What is GitHub Co-Pilot

GitHub Co-Pilot is an AI tool developed by GitHub for major IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and JetBrain with the capability of autocompleting codes. According to GitHub, it is aimed to help you write code faster with less work. 

GitHub Co-Pilot is trained on billions of lines of code, to enable it to turn natural language into code. It is so powerful that you can use it to get suggestions for a whole line of code or function inside your code editor. 

# How does GitHub Co-Pilot Work

It basically works in two ways: 
1. **Generates Code through comments**: GitHub Co-Pilot has the capability to generate code through a comment written in your editor. This is a very interesting feature because it will present you with several options to choose from. 
2. **AutoComplete**: GitHub Co-pilot can help you autocomplete code. This is a powerful feature to help you save time and focus on what is important. 

For full details on GitHub Co-Pilot please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)

# GitHub Co-Pilot Free for students

Recently GitHub announced that Co-Pilot will now be paid ($10 per month, $100 per year) and available to everyone above the age of 13. This announcement is coming after months of releasing the beta version to selected developers who signed up using the waitlist. 

However, students don't have to pay a dime for this, courtesy of the [GitHub Students Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) which provides free access to hundreds of premium tools for students to take advantage of. I have written extensively about GitHub student developer packs and how to take advantage of them [here](https://vickjoe.tech/github-education-a-springboard-for-a-student-developer). 

# Steps to activate your free GitHub Co-Pilot account

The prerequisite for every student is to have the GitHub student's developer Pack enabled.
