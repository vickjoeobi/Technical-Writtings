## S01E01:Introduction to Web 3.0

# Introduction

Words cannot express how happy I am to finally achieve my lifelong dream of being a streamer. This dream and passion have been built into me since I started my journey of educating people on various topics. 

Getting into the web3 space, I asked myself "what can I do to add the most value?". I noticed that web 3 education is one of the core ways to onboard, educate, and update the knowledge of folks both in web 3 and outside web 3. Being a community person that understands the importance and impact of community in growing technology, I started this education in my community. I, therefore sought a bigger stage which I saw through GitHub Education. 

# First Episode in the First Seasons

We finally made it to the first episode. I promised to always keep my blog updated with the takeaway from each episode. Even though there wasn't much to take away from this episode because only the foundation was set, I would be happy to keep you informed.


The video attached below is the full video of the stream, enjoy it, and tell me what you think.

Since this is simply the introductory part of the show, I would skip the major takeaways section. However, if you are opportune, join me every Wednesday between June 1st, 2022 to August 17th, 2022 by 17:00 GMT for a live episode of the Web3 Kickstart show on [GitHub Education Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/githubeducation). 

Till we meet again, PEACE ✌️
